Features
18-megapixel APS-C-size CMOS sensor & DIGIC 4+ image processor
The 18-megapixel APS-C-size CMOS image sensor captures abundant light and detail, which is processed by the powerful DIGIC 4+ image processor to produce images with highly accurate colors, rich contrasts and gradations, and minimal noise even in low light conditions. Compared to smaller smartphone sensors, the large CMOS sensor makes it easier to achieve the shallow depth-of-field necessary for creating a beautiful background blur.

Optical viewfinder for the authentic DSLR experience
Shooting through the what-you-see-is-what-you-get optical viewfinder, users can take advantage of the fast AF to capture fleeting moments. The large grip provides a steady hold, and dials and buttons have been designed for easy, comfortable operation, even when looking through the viewfinder.

Rich photo & video functionality that even beginners can enjoy
In addition to the scene mode presets and Creative filters, the EOS 3000D includes the “Shoot by ambience” function, where users can simply select the word that describes their envisioned atmosphere to capture an image in the corresponding style. The EOS MOVIE mode supports shooting video in various formats including Full HD 30P/25P.
